# tailgating-detection-system<br>
This is the project about one of the major attacks done on the organizations and other restricted areas, where only limited number of people are allowed. And this is <b>Tailgating</b>.<br>
Tailgating is entering into the restricted area by following the authorized person, so that the intruder does not have to provide any valid identification.<br>
This project will be made using Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and a lot of Python. :wink:
